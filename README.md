## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

With regards to the submission process, I still have difficulty using Github. Specifically, Github Desktop is just tricky to use on Mac because files management is tricky to link up through Finder. Specifically, I had trouble trying to find the repository that I made on the Github website on the Github Desktop. After a quick Google search, I found that I just needed to clone the repository to get it to appear in Desktop. Thankfully, I did not need to use Github Desktop to push files since Glitch can push to Github fairly easily on its own. That being said, I do have better experience using Terminal on Mac for pushing and pulling files from Github.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Prior to this assignment, I never really had an interest in web development because I figured that there were enough resources for creating a website without the need to code. Now, I am curious about how websites are developed to work on different platforms like laptops, phones, tablets, etc. I would like to see how in-depth programming can adjust websites to be unique depending on the platform that website is being used on. Besides that, I would also be interested in using more custom designs for the UI such as buttons and fonts. This is simply due to my interest in UI/UX design.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 


If I had more time to work on the project, I would definitely try to add more pattern variability for the game. I would probably make a function that randomly generates a pattern and change the set pattern to the new one and have the game generate a new pattern every time the Start button is pressed. Besides that, I would like to add an Endless button that plays a game that never ends and instead keeps track of your score for the streak you get without messing up the pattern. When the game ends, it will display your total score and your best score in Endless mode.
